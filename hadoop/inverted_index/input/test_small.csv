"717","Alberta"," Website  www.alberta.caAlberta  is a province of Canada. It had an estimated population of 3.7 million in 2010() making it the most populous of Canadas three prairie provinces. Alberta and its neighbour, Saskatchewan, were established as provinces on September 1, 1905.()Alberta is located in Canada, bounded by the provinces of Columbia to the west and Saskatchewan to the east, the Territories to the north, and the state of Montana to the south. Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and is also one of only two provinces that are landlocked.Edmonton, the city of Alberta, is located near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canadas oil sands and other northern resource industries. Approximately  south of the capital is Calgary, Albertas largest city and a major distribution and transportation hub. According to recent population estimates, these two metropolitan areas have now both exceeded 1 million people.() Census agglomerations in the province include Lethbridge, Red Deer, Prairie, Hat, Wood Buffalo (includes McMurray), Lloydminster, Brooks, Okotoks, Camrose, Canmore, Cold Lake, and Wetaskiwin.(  Notable tourist destinations in the province include Canmore, Sylvan Lake, Drumheller, Banff, and Jasper.Alberta is named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta (18481939),() the fourth daughter of Victoria, the of Canada until 1901, and Prince Consort. Princess Louise was the wife of the Marquess of Lorne, General of Canada from 1878 to 1883. Lake Louise, the Village of Caroline, and Alberta were also named in honour of Princess Louise.The current Premier of the province is Redford. Geography Alberta, with an area of () is the fourth largest province after Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia. To the south, the province borders on the parallel north, separating it from the U.S. state of Montana, while on the north the parallel north divides it from the Territories. To the east the meridian west separates it from the province of Saskatchewan, while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the meridian west south from the Northwest Territories at 60N until it reaches the Divide at the Mountains, and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49N.The province extends  north to south and  east to west at its maximum width. Its highest point is  at the summit of Mount Columbia in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border, while its lowest point is  on the River in Buffalo National Park in the northeast.()With the exception of the semi-arid steppe of the southeastern section, the province has adequate resources. There are numerous rivers and lakes used for swimming, fishing and a range of sports. There are three large lakes, Lake Claire () in Buffalo National Park, Slave Lake (), and Athabasca () which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. The longest river in the province is the River which travels  from the Icefield in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca.() The largest river is the Peace River with an average flow of 2161 m3/s. The Peace River originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the River, a tributary of the River.File:Moraine Lake 17092005.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Lake in National Park.Albertas capital city, Edmonton, is located approximately in the geographic centre of the province. It is the most northerly major city in Canada, and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada. The region, with its proximity to Canadas largest fields, has most of western Canadas oil refinery capacity. Calgary is located approximately  south of Edmonton and  north of Montana, surrounded by extensive ranching country. Almost 75% of the provinces population lives in the Corridor.Most of the northern half of the province is forest, while the Mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested (see Mountain forests and Columbia foothills forests). The southern quarter of the province is prairie, ranging from prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it. The central parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests, from Calgary, north to Edmonton, and then east to Lloydminster, contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population. Much of the unforested part of Alberta is given over either to grain or to farming, with farming more common in the north and centre, while ranching and agriculture predominate in the south.()The Alberta badlands are located in southeastern Alberta, where the Deer River crosses the flat prairie and farmland, and features deep canyons and striking landforms. Provincial Park, near Alberta, showcases the badlands terrain, desert flora, and remnants from Albertas past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape. Climate Alberta has a dry climate with warm summers and cold winters. The province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north, which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter. As the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across Alberta, temperature can change rapidly. Arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from  in northern Alberta to  in southern Alberta. In the summer, continental air masses produce maximum temperatures from  in the mountains to  in southern Alberta.()Alberta extends for over  from north to south; its climate, therefore, varies considerably. Average temperatures in January range from  in the south to  in the north, and in July from  in the south to  in the north.  The climate is also influenced by the presence of the Rocky Mountains to the southwest, which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province, casting a shadow over much of Alberta. The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the Ocean cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean. Annual precipitation ranges from  in the southeast to  in the north, except in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains where rainfall can reach  annually.(In the summer, the average daytime temperatures range from around  in the Rocky Mountain valleys and far north to  in the dry prairie of the southeast. The northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures. The south and east-central portions are prone to drought-like conditions sometimes persisting for several years, although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation.Alberta is a sunny province. Annual bright sunshine totals range between 1900 and 2500 hours per year. Northern Alberta receives about 18 hours of daylight in the summer.(In southwestern Alberta, the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm, dry winds blowing from the mountains, which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period. During one chinook recorded at Creek, temperatures soared from  to  in one hour.(  The region around Lethbridge has the most chinooks, averaging 30 to 35 chinook days per year, while Calgary has a Christmas only 59% of the time as a result of these winds. Northern Alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a climate. The agricultural area of southern Alberta have a semi-arid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants. The southeastern corner of Alberta, part of the Triangle, experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province, and as a result suffers frequent yield problems and occasional severe droughts. Western Alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter winds. Central and parts of northwestern Alberta in the Peace River region are largely aspen parkland, a biome transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north.After Ontario, Alberta is the most likely region in Canada to experience tornadoes. Thunderstorms, some of them severe, are frequent in the summer, especially in central and southern Alberta. The region surrounding the Corridor is notable for having the highest frequency of hail in Canada, which is caused by lifting from the nearby Rocky Mountains, enhancing the updraft/downdraft cycle necessary for the formation of hail.Image:Banff Trail 2.jpg|Winter climate at Banff Trail station in Calgary.Image:DinosaurProvincialParkHoodoo.jpg|Hoodoos in Provincial Park.Image:May 2011 Wildfires in Alberta, Canada.jpg|Satellite image of wildfires in Alberta. Ecology  Flora In central and northern Alberta the arrival of spring brings the prairie crocus anemone, the three flowered avens, bean, wild rose and other early flowers. The advancing summer introduces many flowers of the sunflower family, until in August the plains are one blaze of yellow and purple. The southern and east central parts of Alberta are covered by a short, nutritious grass, which dries up as summer lengthens, to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the prairie coneflower, fleabane, and sage. Both yellow and white clover fill the ditches with their beauty and aromatic scents.The trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides. These are largely deciduous, typically aspen, poplar, and willow. Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain. On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for hundreds of thousands of square kilometres. Aspen poplar, poplar (or cottonwood), and birch are the primary large deciduous species. Conifers include pine, Rocky Mountain pine, pine, both white and black spruce, and the deciduous conifer tamarack. Fauna Image:Ovis canadensis 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The sheep is Albertas provincial animalThe four climatic regions (alpine, forest, parkland, and prairie) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals. The south and central prairie was the land of the bison, commonly known as buffalo, its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo. The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement, but since then buffalo have made a comeback, living on farms and in parks all over Alberta.Alberta is home to many large carnivores. Among them are the grizzly and black bears, which are found in the mountains and wooded regions. Smaller carnivores of the canine and feline families include coyotes, wolves, fox, lynx, bobcat and lion (cougar).Herbivorous animals are found throughout the province. Moose, deer, and deer are found in the wooded regions, and pronghorn can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta. sheep and goats live in the Mountains. Rabbits, porcupines, skunks, squirrels and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province. Alberta is home to only one variety of snake, the prairie rattlesnake.thumb|left|200px|Water birds in EdmontonCentral and northern Alberta and the region farther north is the nesting ground of many migratory birds. Vast numbers of ducks, geese, swans and pelicans arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. Eagles, hawks, owls and crows are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found. Alberta, like other temperate regions, is home to mosquitoes, flies, wasps, and bees. Rivers and lakes are populated with pike, walleye, whitefish, rainbow, speckled, and brown trout, and even sturgeon. Turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province. Frogs and salamanders are a few of the amphibians that make their homes in Alberta.Alberta is the only province in Canadaas well as one of the few places in the worldthat is free of Norwegian rats.() Since the early 1950s, the government of Alberta has operated a rat-control program, which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported, usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail. In 2006, Alberta Agriculture reports zero findings of wild rats; the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners. It is illegal for individual Albertans to own or keep Norwegian rats of any description; the animals can be kept in the province by only zoos, universities and colleges, and recognized research institutions. In 2009, several rats werefound and captured, in small pockets in Southern Alberta,() putting Albertas rat-free status in jeopardy. History File:Alexander Rutherford.jpg|right|thumb|150px|C. Rutherford, Albertas first premierThe first people in Alberta were Paleo-Indians who arrived in Alberta at least 10,000 years ago, toward the end of the ice age. They probably migrated from Siberia to Alaska on a land bridge across the Strait, and then may have moved down the east side of the Mountains through Alberta to settle the Americas. Alternatively they may have migrated down the coast of British Columbia and then moved inland.() Over time they differentiated into various Nations peoples, including the Indian tribes of southern Alberta such as those of the Confederacy and the Cree, who generally lived by hunting buffalo (bison), and the more northerly tribes such as the Cree and  Chipewyan who hunted, trapped, and fished for a living.()After the British arrival in Canada, approximately half of the province of Alberta, south of the River drainage, became part of Land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into Bay. This area was granted by II of England to the Bay Company (HBC) in 1670, and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it. After the arrival of Canadians in the west around 1731, they settled near fur trading posts, establishing communities such as Lac La Biche and Bonnyville. Fort La Jonquire was established near what is now Calgary in 1752.The Athabasca River and the rivers north of it were not in HBC territory because they drained into the Ocean instead of Hudson Bay, and they were prime habitat for fur-bearing animals. The first explorer of the Athabasca region was Pond, who learned of the Portage, which allowed travel from southern  rivers into the rivers north of Ruperts Land.  Fur traders formed the West Company (NWC) of Montreal to compete with the HBC in 1779. The NWC occupied the northern part of Alberta territory. Peter Pond built Fort Athabasca on Lac la Biche in 1778. Roderick Mackenzie built Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca ten years later in 1788. His cousin, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, followed the Saskatchewan River to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then setting northward on foot, trekked to the Athabasca River, which he followed to Lake Athabasca. It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his namethe Riverwhich he followed to its outlet in the Ocean. Returning to Lake Athabasca, he followed the Peace River upstream, eventually reaching the Ocean, and so he became the first white man to cross the North American continent north of Mexico.()The extreme southernmost portion of Alberta was part of the French (and Spanish) territory of Louisiana, sold to the United States in 1803; in 1818, the portion of Louisiana north of the Forty-Ninth Parallel was ceded to Great Britain.Fur trade expanded in the north, but bloody battles occurred between the rival HBC and NWC, and in 1821 the British government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities. The amalgamated Hudsons Bay Company dominated trade in Alberta until 1870, when the newly formed Government purchased Ruperts Land. Northern Alberta was included in the Territory until 1870, when it and Ruperts land became Canadas Territories.The district of Alberta was created as part of the North-West Territories in 1882. As settlement increased, local representatives to the North-West Legislative Assembly were added. After a long campaign for autonomy, in 1905 the district of Alberta was enlarged and given provincial status, with the election of Cameron Rutherford as the first premier. Demographics Alberta has enjoyed a relatively high rate of growth in recent years, mainly because of its burgeoning economy. Between 2003 and 2004, the province had high birthrates (on par with some larger provinces such as British Columbia), relatively high immigration, and a high rate of interprovincial migration when compared to other provinces.()Approximately 81% of the population live in urban areas and only about 19% live in rural areas. The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized area in the province and is one of the most densely populated areas of Canada.() Many of Albertas cities and towns have also experienced very high rates of growth in recent history. Over the past century, Albertas population rose from 73,022 in 1901 to 2,974,807 in 2001() and 3,290,350 according to the 2006 census.()The 2006 census found that English, with 2,576,670 native speakers, was the most common mother tongue of Albertans, representing 79.99% of the provinces population. The next most common mother tongues were various languages with 97,275 native speakers (3.02%), followed by German with 84,505 native speakers (2.62%) and French with 61,225 (1.90%).()Other mother tongues (in decreasing order) include: Punjabi, with 36,320 native speakers (1.13%); Tagalog, with 29,740 (0.92%); Ukrainian, with 29,455 (0.91%); Spanish, with 29,125 (0.90%); Polish, with 21,990 (0.68%); Arabic, with 20,495 (0.64%); Dutch, with 19,980 (0.62%); and Vietnamese, with 19,350 (0.60%). The most common aboriginal language is Cree 17,215 (0.53%). Other common  mother tongues include Italian with 13,095 speakers (0.41%); Urdu with 11,275 (0.35%); and Korean with 10,845 (0.33%); then Hindi 8,985 (0.28%); Persian 7,700 (0.24%); Portuguese 7,205 (0.22%); and Hungarian 6,770 (0.21%).(Figures shown are for the number of single language responses and the percentage of total single-language responses.)(Alberta has considerable ethnic diversity. In line with the rest of Canada, many immigrants originated from England,  Scotland, Ireland and Wales, but large numbers also came from other parts of Europe, notably Germans, French, Ukrainians and Scandinavians.() According to Statistics Canada, Alberta is home to the second highest proportion (two percent) of Francophones in western Canada (after Manitoba). Despite this, relatively few Albertans claim French as their mother tongue. Many of Albertas French-speaking residents live in the central and northwestern regions of the province.As reported in the 2001 census, the Chinese represented nearly four percent of Albertas population, and East Indians represented more than two percent. Both Edmonton and Calgary have historic Chinatowns, and Calgary has Canadas third largest Chinese community. The Chinese presence began with workers employed in the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s. Aboriginal Albertans make up approximately three percent of the population.In the 2006 Canadian census, the most commonly reported ethnic origins among Albertans were: 885,825 English (27.2%); 679,705 German (20.9%); 667,405 Canadian (20.5%); 661,265 Scottish (20.3%); 539,160 Irish (16.6%); 388,210 French (11.9%); 332,180 Ukrainian (10.2%); 172,910 Dutch (5.3%); 170,935 Polish (5.2%); 169,355 American Indian (5.2%); 144,585 Norwegian (4.4%); and 137,600 Chinese (4.2%). (Each person could choose as many ethnicities as were applicable.)()Amongst those of British origins, the Scots have had a particularly strong influence on place-names, with the names of many cities and towns including Calgary, Airdrie, Canmore, and Banff having Scottish origins.Alberta is the third most diverse province in terms of minorities after British Columbia and Ontario with 13.9% of the population consisting of minorities.() Nearly one-fourth of the populations of Calgary and Edmonton belong to a visible minority group.()Aboriginal Identity Peoples make up 5.8% of the population, about half of whom consist of American Indians and the other half are Metis. There are also small number of Inuit people in Alberta.() The number of Aboriginal Identity Peoples have been increasing at a rate greater than the population of Alberta.(As of the 2001 Census the largest religious group was Roman Catholic, representing 25.7% of the population. Alberta had the second highest percentage of non-religious residents in Canada (after British Columbia) at 23.1% of the population. Of the remainder, 13.5% of the population identified themselves as belonging to the Church of Canada, while 5.9% were Anglican. Lutherans made up 4.8% of the population while Baptists comprised 2.5%.The remainder belonged to a wide variety of different religious affiliations, none of which constituted more than 2% of the population. The Mormons of Alberta reside primarily in the extreme south of the province and made up 1.7% of the population. Alberta has a population of Hutterites, a communal Anabaptist sect similar to the Mennonites (Hutterites represented 0.4% of the population while Mennonites were 0.8%), and has a significant population of Seventh-day Adventists at 0.3%. Alberta is home to several Rite Churches as part of the legacy of Eastern European immigration, including the Catholic Eparchy of Edmonton, and the Orthodox Church of Canadas Western Diocese which is based in Edmonton.()Muslims, Sikhs, and Hindus live in Alberta. Muslims constituted 1.7% of the population, Sikhs 0.8% and Hindus 0.5%. Many of these are recent immigrants, but others have roots that go back to the first settlers of the prairies.( Canadas oldest mosque, the Mosque is located in Edmonton,() whereas the Canadas largest mosque, the Nur mosque is located in Calgary.() Jews constituted 0.4% of Albertas population. Most of Albertas 13,000 Jews live in Calgary (7,500) and Edmonton (5,000).(AM YisraelThe Jewish Communities of Canada) Municipalities ;Largest metro areas and municipalities by population as of 2006File:Edmonton Skyline Panorama.jpg|thumb|800px|center|EdmontonFile:Calgary panorama-2.jpg|thumb|800px|center|Calgary Economy Albertas economy is one of the strongest in Canada, supported by the burgeoning petroleum industry and to a lesser extent, agriculture and technology. The per capita GDP in 2007 was by far the highest of any province in Canada at C$74,825. This was 61% higher than the national average of C$46,441 and more than twice that of some of the Atlantic provinces. In 2006 the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in Canadian history.() According to the 2006 census,() the median annual family income after taxes was $70,986 in Alberta (compared to $60,270 in Canada as a whole).The Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. The region covers a distance of roughly 400 kilometres north to south. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Albertas population).() It is also one of the fastest growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by Bank Financial Group found the corridor to be the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S. level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian style of life, offering health care benefits. The study found that GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other Canadian cities at that time.The Institute states that Alberta also has very high levels of freedom and rates Alberta as the freest economy in Canada,() and the second freest economy amongst U.S. states and Canadian provinces.() Industry File:Syncrude mildred lake plant.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mildred Lake mine site and plant at the Oil Sands.Alberta is the largest producer of conventional crude oil, crude, gas and gas products in the country. Alberta is the worlds 2nd largest exporter of natural gas and the 4th largest producer.() Two of the largest producers of petrochemicals in America are located in central and north-central Alberta. In both Red Deer and Edmonton, world class polyethylene and vinyl manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmontons oil refineries provide the raw materials for a large petrochemical industry to the east of Edmonton.The oil sands have estimated oil reserves approximately equal to the oil reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be 1.6 trillion barrels (254 km3). With the development of new extraction methods such as assisted gravity drainage, which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional strip mining and non-conventional situ methods to extract the bitumen from the sands. With current technology and at current prices, about 315 billion barrels (50 km3) of bitumen are recoverable. McMurray, one of Canadas fastest growing  cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.()Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the sands is the price of oil. The price increases since 2003 have made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.With concerted effort and support from the provincial government, several high-tech industries have found their birth in Alberta, notably patents related to interactive crystal display systems.(Interactive display systemUS Patent U.S. Patent No. 5,448,263; U.S. Patent for Touch Sensitive TechnologySMART Technologies) With a growing economy, Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds. Agriculture and forestry File:Warner Elevator Row.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The elevator row, the last surviving elevator row in Alberta, currently unprotected.Agriculture has a significant position in the provinces economy. The province has over three million head of cattle,(Alberta Livestock InspectionsAugust 2006Alberta Government, Department of Agriculture) and Alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains buffalo (bison) for the consumer market. Sheep for wool and mutton are also raised.Wheat and canola are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production; other grains are also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing; farmers typically truck the grain to central points.Alberta is the leading beekeeping province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering hives indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the Peace River valley where the season is short but the working days are long for honeybees to produce honey from clover and fireweed. Hybrid canola also requires bee pollination, and some beekeepers service this need.The vast northern forest reserves of softwood allow Alberta to produce large quantities of lumber, oriented strand board (OSB) and plywood, and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the Rim nations with bleached pulp and newsprint. Tourism File:Stephen Avenue.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Avenue, Calgary.Alberta has been a tourist destination from the early days of the twentieth century, with attractions including outdoor locales for skiing, hiking and camping, shopping locales such as Edmonton Mall, Stampede, outdoor festivals, professional athletic events, international sporting competitions such as the Games and Games, as well as more eclectic attractions. There are also natural attractions like Island National Park, Buffalo National Park, and the Icefield.According to Alberta Economic Development, Calgary and Edmonton both host over four million visitors annually. Banff, Jasper and the Rocky Mountains are visited by about three million people per year.() Alberta tourism relies heavily on Ontario tourists, as well as tourists from other parts of Canada, the States, and many international countries.Albertas Rocky Mountains include well known tourist destinations Banff National Park and National Park. The two mountain parks are connected by the scenic Parkway. Banff is located  west of Calgary on Highway 1, and Jasper is located  west of Edmonton on Highway. Five of Canadas fourteen UNESCO heritage sites are located within the province: Rocky Mountain Parks, International Peace Park, Wood Buffalo National Park, Provincial Park and Buffalo Jump.File:Lake Louise 17092005.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Lake Louise in the Rockies.About 1.2 million people visit the of Stampede,() a celebration of Canadas own West and the cattle ranching industry. About 700,000 people enjoy Edmontons Ex (formerly Klondike Days).() Edmonton was the gateway to the only all-Canadian route to the Yukon gold fields, and the only route which did not require gold-seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous Pass.Another tourist destination that draws more than 650,000 visitors each year is the Drumheller Valley, located northeast of Calgary. Drumheller, Dinosaur Capital of The World, offers the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology. Drumheller also had a rich mining history being one of Western Canadas largest coal producers during the war years. The Canadian Badlands has much to offer in the way of attractions, cultural events, celebrations, accommodations and service.Located in east-central Alberta is Prairie Railway Excursions, a popular tourist attraction operated out of Stettler. It boasts one of the few operable steam trains in the world, offering trips through the rolling prairie scenery. Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions caters to tens of thousands of visitors every year.Alberta is an important destination for tourists who love to ski and hike; Alberta boasts several world-class resorts such as Village, Lake Louise, Basin, Norquay and Nakiska. Hunters and fishermen from around the world are able to take home impressive trophies and tales from their experiences in Albertas wilderness. Taxation The provinces revenue comes mainly from royalties on non-renewable natural resources (30.4%), personal income taxes (22.3%), corporate and other taxes (19.6%), and grants from the federal government primarily for infrastructure projects (9.8%).() Albertans are the lowest-taxed people in Canada, and Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial tax (though residents are still subject to the federal sales tax, the Goods and Services Tax of 5%.) It is also the only Canadian province to have a single rate of taxation for personal income taxes which is 10% of taxable income.()The Alberta tax system maintains a progressive character by allowing residents to earn $16,161 before becoming subject to provincial taxation in addition to a variety of tax deductions for persons with disabilities, students, and the aged.() Albertas municipalities and school jurisdictions have their own governments which (usually) work in co-operation with the provincial government.Alberta also privatized alcohol distribution.  The privatization increased outlets from 304 stores to 1,726; 1,300 jobs to 4,000 jobs; and 3,325 products to 16,495 products.() Tax revenue also increased from $400 million to $700 million. Transportation File:DavidThompsonHighway.JPG|right|thumb|220px|David Thompson Highway outside of National Park.Alberta has over  of highways and roads, of which nearly  are paved. The main north-south corridor is Highway 2, which begins south of Cardston at the Carway border crossing and is part of the Corridor. Highway 4, which effectively extends 15 into Alberta and is the busiest U.S. gateway to the province, begins at the Coutts border crossing and ends at Lethbridge. Highway 3 joins Lethbridge to Fort Macleod and links Highway 4 to Highway 2. Highway 2 travels northward through Fort Macleod, Calgary, Red Deer, and Edmonton.North of Edmonton, the highway continues to Athabasca, then northwesterly along the south shore of Slave Lake into High Prairie, north to Peace River, west to Fairview and finally south to Prairie, where it ends at an interchange with Highway 43. The section of Highway 2 between Calgary and Edmonton has been named the Elizabeth II Highway to commemorate the visit of the monarch in 2005.  Highway 2 is supplemented by two more highways that run parallel to it: Highway 22, west of Highway 2, known as Cowboy Trail, and Highway 21, east of Highway 2. Highway 43 travels northwest into Grande Prairie and the River Country; Highway 63 travels northeast to McMurray, the location of the Athabasca Oil Sands.Alberta has two main east-west corridors. The southern corridor, part of the Highway system, enters the province near Medicine Hat, runs westward through Calgary, and leaves Alberta through Banff National Park. The northern corridor, also part of the Trans-Canada network and known as the Highway (Highway 16), runs west from Lloydminster in eastern Alberta, through Edmonton and National Park into Columbia. One of the most scenic drives is along the Parkway, which runs for  between Jasper and Lake Louise, with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length.Another major corridor through central Alberta is Highway 11 (also known as the David Thompson Highway), which runs east from the Saskatchewan River Crossing in Banff National Park through Mountain House and Red Deer, connecting with Highway 12  west of Stettler. The highway connects many of the smaller towns in central Alberta with Calgary and Edmonton, as it crosses Highway 2 just west of Red Deer.Urban stretches of Albertas major highways and freeways are often called trails. For example, Highway 2, the main north-south highway in the province, is called Trail as it passes through Calgary but becomes Trail (for southbound traffic) and Boulevard (for northbound traffic) as it enters Edmonton and then turns into St. Albert Trail as it leaves Edmonton for the City of St. Albert. Calgary, in particular, has a tradition of calling its largest urban expressways trails and naming many of them after prominent Nations individuals and tribes, such as Trail, Deerfoot Trail, and Trail.Calgary, Edmonton, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, and Lethbridge have substantial transit systems. In addition to buses, Calgary and Edmonton operate rail transit (LRT) systems. LRT, which is underground in the downtown core and on the surface outside of it, was the first of the modern generation of light rail systems to be built in North America, while the Calgary C-Train has one of the highest number of daily riders of any LRT system in North America.Alberta is well-connected by air, with airports in both Calgary and Edmonton. International Airport and International Airport are the fourth and fifth busiest in Canada respectively. Calgarys airport is a hub for WestJet Airlines and a regional hub for Canada. Calgarys airport primarily serves the Canadian prairie provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) for connecting flights to British Columbia, eastern Canada, 15 major US centres, nine European airports, one Asian airport and four destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean.()  Edmontons airport acts as a hub for the Canadian north and has connections to all major Canadian airports as well as 10 major US airports, 3 European airports and 6 Mexican and Caribbean airports.()There are over  of operating mainline railway, and many tourists see Alberta aboard Rail or Mountaineer. The Pacific Railway and National Railway companies operate railway freight across the province. Health care File:Alberta Childrens Hospital 3+4.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Childrens HospitalAs with all Canadian provinces, Alberta provides for all citizens and residents through a funded health care system. Alberta became Canadas second province (after Saskatchewan) to adopt a Douglas-style program in 1950, a precursor to the modern medicare system.Albertas health care budget is currently $13.2 billion during the 20082009 fiscal year (approximately 36% of all government spending), making it the best funded health care system per-capita in Canada. Every hour more than $1.5 million is spent on health care in the province.()File:University Hospital Complex University Of Alberta Edmonton Alberta Canada 02A.jpg|thumb|220px|left|of Alberta Hospital complex.A highly educated population and burgeoning economy have made Alberta a national leader in health education, research, and resources. Many notable facilities include the Medical Centre, the Lougheed Centre, General Hospital, Childrens Hospital, Grace Womens Health Centre, The University of Calgary Medical Centre (UCMC), Baker Cancer Centre and Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta, in Calgary; In Edmonton, the of Alberta Hospital,  the Royal Alexandra Hospital, the Alberta Heart Institute, the Lois Hole Hospital for Women, the Childrens Hospital, the Alberta Diabetes Institute, the Cancer Institute, and the Rexall Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research in Edmonton. Currently under construction in Edmonton is the new $909 million Clinic, which will provide a similar research, education, and care environment as the Clinic in the States.()Care in Alberta is administered by the unified Alberta Health Services Board. Prior to July 1, 2008, Alberta was divided into nine health regions: Regional Health Authority: Health Region, Health (Edmonton), Health, Thompson Regional Health Authority, Central Health, Lights Health Region, Health Region and Country Health Region.The Trauma Air Rescue Society, a nonprofit organization, provides an ambulance service to all but the most remote areas of Alberta, and some adjoining areas of British Columbia.() Government File:Edmonton leg.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Albertas Legislative Building in Edmonton.The government of Alberta is organized as a parliamentary democracy with a unicameral legislature.  Its unicameral legislaturethe Legislative Assemblyconsists of eighty-three members.Locally municipal governments and school boards are elected and operate separately. Their boundaries do not necessarily coincide.  Municipalities where the same body act as both local government and school board are formally referred to as counties in Alberta.As Canadas of state, Elizabeth II is the head of state for the Government of Alberta. Her duties in Alberta are carried out by Lieutenant Governor Ethell.  Although the lieutenant governor is technically the most powerful person in Alberta, he is in reality a figurehead whose actions are restricted by custom and constitutional convention.  The government is therefore headed by the premier. The current premier is Redford who was elected as leader of the governing Progressive Conservatives on October 1, 2011.  Redford was sworn in as the 14th of Alberta on October 7, 2011.The Premier is a Member of the Legislative Assembly, and he draws all the members of his Cabinet from among the members of the Legislative Assembly.The City of Edmonton is the seat of the provincial governmentthe capital of Alberta.Albertas elections tend to yield results which are much more conservative than those of other Canadian provinces. Alberta has traditionally had three political parties, the Progressive Conservatives (Conservatives or Tories), the Liberals, and the social democratic New Democrats. A fourth party, the strongly conservative Social Credit Party, was a power in Alberta for many decades, but fell from the political map after the Progressive Conservatives came to power in 1971. Since that time, no other political party has governed Alberta. In fact, only four parties have governed Alberta: the Liberals, from 1905 to 1921; the Farmers of Alberta, from 1921 to 1935; the Social Credit Party, from 1935 to 1971, and the currently governing Progressive Conservative Party, from 1971 to the present.Alberta has had occasional surges in separatist sentiment. Even during the 1980s, when these feelings were at their strongest, there has never been enough interest in secession to initiate any major movements or referendums. There are several groups wishing to promote the independence of Alberta in some form currently active in the province.In the 2008 provincial election, held on March 3, 2008, the Progressive Conservative Party was re-elected as a majority government with 72 of 83 seats, the Liberal Party was elected as the Official Opposition with nine members, and two New Democratic Party members were elected.() Education File:SAIT Heart Building 2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Heritage Hall at Polytechnic.As with any Canadian province, the Alberta Legislature has (almost) exclusive authority to make laws respecting education. Since 1905 the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated prior to 1905, as well as to create and/or regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, home schooling). Elementary schools There are forty-two public school jurisdictions in Alberta, and seventeen operating separate school jurisdictions. Sixteen of the operating separate school jurisdictions have a Catholic electorate, and one (St. Albert) has a Protestant electorate. In addition, one Protestant separate school district, Glen Avon, survives as a ward of the St. Paul Education Region. The City of Lloydminster straddles the Alberta/Saskatchewan border, and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers: both of them operate according to Saskatchewan law.For many years the provincial government has funded the greater part of the cost of providing K12 education. Prior to 1994 public and separate school boards in Alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property, as supplementary support for local education. In 1994 the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards, but not for separate school boards. Since 1994 there has continued to be a tax on property in support of K12 education; the difference is that the mill rate is now set by the provincial government, the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government. The relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of K12 education provided by school boards. The provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them, according to a formula, to public and separate school jurisdictions and Francophone authorities.Public and separate school boards, schools, and schools all follow the Program of Studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education (Alberta Education). Home schoolers may choose to follow the Program of Studies or develop their own Program of Studies.  Public and separate schools, charter schools, and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by Alberta Education, they administer Provincial Achievement Tests and Diploma Examinations set by Alberta Education, and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by Alberta Education. Universities File:Saint Josephs College University Of Alberta Edmonton Alberta Canada 02A.jpg|thumb|230px|right|St. Josephs College at the of Alberta.The of Alberta, established in Edmonton in 1908, is Albertas oldest and largest university. The of Calgary, once affiliated with the University of Alberta, gained its autonomy in 1966 and is now the second largest university in Alberta. There is also University, which focuses on distance learning, and the of Lethbridge, both of which are located in their title cities.In early September 2009, Royal University became Calgarys second public university, and in late September 2009, a similar move made MacEwan University Edmontons second public university. There are 15 colleges that receive direct public funding, along with two technical institutes, Alberta Institute of Technology and Alberta Institute of Technology.()There is also a large and active private sector of post-secondary institutions, mostly Christian Universities, bringing the total number of universities to twelve, plus a University in Calgary, the only location in Canada. Students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions. There has been some controversy in recent years over the rising cost of post-secondary education for students (as opposed to taxpayers). In 2005, Premier Klein made a promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs.() So far, no plan has been released by the government of Alberta. Culture File:StampedeRodeo2002.JPG|200px|right|thumb|The Stampede.Summer brings many festivals to the province of Alberta, especially in Edmonton. The Fringe Festival is the worlds  second largest after Edinburghs. Both Calgary and Edmonton host a number of annual festivals and events including folk music festivals. With a large number of summer and winter events, Edmonton prides itself as being the Festival City. The citys heritage days festival sees the participation of over 70 ethnic groups. Edmontons Churchill Square is home to a large number of the festivals, including the large Taste of Edmonton & Works Art & Design Festival throughout the summer months.The City of Calgary is also famous for its Stampede, dubbed The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth. The Stampede is Canadas biggest rodeo festival and features various races and competitions, such as roping and riding. In line with the western tradition of rodeo are the cultural artisans that reside and create unique Alberta western heritage crafts.The Centre hosts a range of festivals and other events including the international Mountain Film Festival. These cultural events in Alberta highlight the provinces cultural diversity. Most of the major cities have several performing theatre companies who entertain in venues as diverse as Edmontons Arts Barns and the Winspear Centre for Music. Both Calgary and Edmonton are home to Football League and Hockey League teams. Soccer, union and lacrosse are also played professionally in Alberta.PaleontologyFile:Pachyrhinosaurus skull.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pachyrhinosaurus skull. Large quantities of this genus are preserved in the Formation.Alberta has one of the greatest diversities and abundances of Cretaceous dinosaur fossils in the world.( Taxa are represented by complete fossil skeletons, isolated material, microvertebrate remains, and even mass graves.( At least 38 dinosaur specimens are known from the province.( The Formation, Formation and Park Formations collectively comprise the Judith River Group and are the most thoroughly studied dinosaur bearing strata in Alberta.( The stratigraphy of the River Group has a confusing history due partly to the use of the Montana-Alberta border as an artificial division between equivalent strata.( The modern Judith River Group stratigraphy was not finalized until 1993 when Eberth and Hamblin divided the Oldman Formation in two to create the new Dinosaur Park Formation.( The resulting paleontological confusion was resolved by Currie who relocated old quarries dinosaurs had been found in and determined their distribution within the modern stratigraphic framework.(Dinosaur-bearing strata are distributed widely through-out Alberta.( The Provincial Park area contains outcrops of the Dinosaur Park Formation and Oldman Formation.( In the central and southern regions of Alberta are intermittent Formation outcrops.( In the Valley and Edmonton regions there are exposed Horseshoe Canyon facies. Other formations have been recorded as well, like the Milk River and Foremost Formations.( However, these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs, primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops.( Their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites.( Additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the River Group and Mary River Formations of the southwest and the northwestern Formation.( The Wapiti Formations contains two Pachyrhinosaurus bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity, however.( The Formation represents strata deposited during a transgression.( Dinosaurs are known from this Formation, but represent specimens washed out to sea or reworked from older sediments.(Ryan, M.

"1164","Artificial intelligence","File:TOPIO 3.0.jpg|350px|thumb|TOPIO, a robot, played tennis at Tokyo Robot Exhibition (IREX) 2009.(Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines and the branch of science that aims to create it. AI textbooks define the field as the study and design of intelligent agents( where an agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success.( John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1956,( defines it as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.(The field was founded on the claim that a central property of humans, intelligencethe sapience of sapienscan be so precisely described that it can be simulated by a machine.(See the Dartmouth proposal, under Philosophy, below.) This raises philosophical issues about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings, issues which have been addressed by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity.( Artificial intelligence has been the subject of optimism,(The optimism referred to includes the predictions of early AI researchers (see optimism in the history of AI) as well as the ideas of modern transhumanists such as Kurzweil.) but has also suffered setbacks(The setbacks referred to include the ALPAC report of 1966, the abandonment of perceptrons in 1970, the Lighthill Report of 1973 and the collapse of the lisp machine market in 1987.) and, today, has become an essential part of the technology industry, providing the heavy lifting for many of the most difficult problems in computer science.(AI research is highly technical and specialized, and deeply divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other.( Subfields have grown up around particular institutions, the work of individual researchers, the solution of specific problems, longstanding differences of opinion about how AI should be done and the application of widely differing tools. The central problems of AI include such traits as reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, communication, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.( General intelligence (or AI) is still among the fields long term goals.( HistoryThinking machines and artificial beings appear in myths, such as Talos of Crete, the bronze robot of Hephaestus, and Pygmalions Galatea.( Human likenesses believed to have intelligence were built in every major civilization: animated images were worshipped in Egypt and Greece( and humanoid automatons were built by Yan Shi, of Alexandria and Al-Jazari.( It was also widely believed that artificial beings had been created by ibn Hayyn, Loew and Paracelsus.( By the 19th and 20th centuries, artificial beings had become a common feature in fiction, as in Shelleys Frankenstein or apeks (Rossums Universal Robots).( McCorduck argues that all of these are examples of an ancient urge, as she describes it, to forge the gods.( Stories of these creatures and their fates discuss many of the same hopes, fears and ethical concerns that are presented by artificial intelligence.Mechanical or formal reasoning has been developed by philosophers and mathematicians since antiquity. The study of logic led directly to the invention of the programmable digital electronic computer, based on the work of mathematician Turing and others. Turings of computation suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1, could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction.(This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known as the thesis.)( This, along with concurrent discoveries in neurology, theory and cybernetics, inspired a small group of researchers to begin to seriously consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.(The field of AI research was founded at a conference on the campus of College in the summer of 1956.( The attendees, including John McCarthy, Minsky, Newell and Simon, became the leaders of AI research for many decades.( They and their students wrote programs that were, to most people, simply astonishing:(Russell and Norvig write it was astonishing whenever a computer did anything kind of smartish. ) computers were solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.( By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense( and laboratories had been established around the world.( AIs founders were profoundly optimistic about the future of the new field: Simon predicted that machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do and Minsky agreed, writing that within a generation ... the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved.(They had failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the problems they faced.(See ) In 1974, in response to the criticism of James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off all undirected exploratory research in AI. The next few years, when funding for projects was hard to find, would later be called the winter.(In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of systems,( a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of one or more human experts. By 1985 the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japans generation computer project inspired the U.S and British governments to restore funding for academic research in the field.( However, beginning with the collapse of the Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer lasting winter began.(In the 1990s and early 21st century, AI achieved its greatest successes, albeit somewhat behind the scenes. Artificial intelligence is used for logistics, mining, diagnosis and many other areas throughout the technology industry.(The success was due to several factors: the increasing computational power of computers (see law), a greater emphasis on solving specific subproblems, the creation of new ties between AI and other fields working on similar problems, and a new commitment by researchers to solid mathematical methods and rigorous scientific standards.(On 11 May 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Kasparov.() In 2005, a Stanford robot won the Grand Challenge by driving autonomously for 131 miles along an unrehearsed desert trail.(DARPA Grand Challenge  home page)In February 2011, in a Jeopardy! show exhibition match, IBMs answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Rutter and Jennings, by a significant margin.()The leading-edge definition of artificial intelligence research is changing over time. One pragmatic definition is: AI research is that which computing scientists do not know how to do cost-effectively today. For example, in 1956 character recognition (OCR) was considered AI, but today, sophisticated OCR software with a context-sensitive checker and checker software comes for free with most scanners. No one would any longer consider already-solved computing science problems like OCR artificial intelligence today.Low-cost entertaining chess-playing software is commonly available for tablet computers. DARPA no longer provides significant funding for chess-playing computing system development. The Kinect which provides a 3D bodymotion interface for the 360 uses algorithms that emerged from lengthy AI research,(Kinects AI breakthrough explained) but few consumers realize the technology source.AI applications are no longer the exclusive domain of of defense R&D, but are now common place consumer items and inexpensive intelligent toys.In common usage, the term AI no longer seems to apply to off-the-shelf solved computing-science problems, which may have originally emerged out of years of AI research. Problems Can a machine act intelligently? is still an problem. Taking A machine can act intelligently as a hypothesis, many researchers have attempted to build such a machine.The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into a number of specific sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers would like an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.(Deduction, reasoning, problem solving Early AI researchers developed algorithms that imitated the step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.( By the late 1980s and 90s, AI research had also developed highly successful methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.(For difficult problems, most of these algorithms can require enormous computational resources  most experience a explosion: the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical when the problem goes beyond a certain size. The search for more efficient problem solving algorithms is a high priority for AI research.(Human beings solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments rather than the conscious, step-by-step deduction that early AI research was able to model.( AI has made some progress at imitating this kind of sub-symbolic problem solving: agent approaches emphasize the importance of sensorimotor skills to higher reasoning; net research attempts to simulate the structures inside human and animal brains that give rise to this skill.Knowledge representationright|thumb|An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.representation( and engineering( are central to AI research. Many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things that AI needs to represent are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;( situations, events, states and time;( causes and effects;( knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);( and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of what exists is an ontology (borrowing a word from traditional philosophy), of which the most general are called upper ontologies.(Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are:;reasoning and the problem: Many of the things people know take the form of working assumptions. For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. John McCarthy identified this problem in 1969( as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.(;The breadth of knowledge: The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is astronomical. Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of knowledge (e.g., Cyc) require enormous amounts of laborious ontological engineering  they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.( A major goal is to have the computer understand enough concepts to be able to learn by reading from sources like the internet, and thus be able to add to its own ontology.;The subsymbolic form of some knowledge: Much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally. For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it feels too exposed() or an art critic can take one look at a statue and instantly realize that it is a fake.() These are intuitions or tendencies that are represented in the brain non-consciously and sub-symbolically.( Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge. As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that situated AI or intelligence will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.(PlanningImage:Hierarchical-control-system.svg|thumb| A control system is a form of system in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchy.Intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.( They need a way to visualize the future (they must have a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it) and be able to make choices that maximize the utility (or value) of the available choices.(In classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only thing acting on the world and it can be certain what the consequences of its actions may be.( However, if this is not true, it must periodically check if the world matches its predictions and it must change its plan as this becomes necessary, requiring the agent to reason under uncertainty.(planning uses the cooperation and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal. behavior such as this is used by algorithms and intelligence.(Learninglearning( has been central to AI research from the beginning.(Turing discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper Machinery and Intelligence. ) In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, Solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: An Inductive Inference Machine.((pdf scanned copy of the original) (version published in 1957, An Inductive Inference Machine, IRE Convention Record, Section on Information Theory, Part 2, pp. 56-62))learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input. learning includes both classification and numerical regression. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression takes a set of numerical input/output examples and attempts to discover a continuous function that would generate the outputs from the inputs. In learning( the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. These can be analyzed in terms of theory, using concepts like utility. The mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of computer science known as learning theory.(Natural language processingFile:ParseTree.svg|thumb| A tree represents the syntactic structure of a sentence according to some grammar.language processing( gives machines the ability to read and understand the languages that humans speak. Many researchers hope that a sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would be able to acquire knowledge on its own, by reading the existing text available over the internet. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include retrieval (or mining) and translation.(Motion and manipulationThe field of robotics( is closely related to AI. Intelligence is required for robots to be able to handle such tasks as object manipulation( and navigation, with sub-problems of localization (knowing where you are), mapping (learning what is around you) and planning (figuring out how to get there).(Perceptionperception( is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, sonar and others more exotic) to deduce aspects of the world. vision( is the ability to analyze visual input. A few selected subproblems are recognition,( facial recognition and recognition.(Social intelligencerobot at MIT Museum.jpg|thumb|Kismet, a robot with rudimentary social skillsEmotion and social skills( play two roles for an intelligent agent. First, it must be able to predict the actions of others, by understanding their motives and emotional states. (This involves elements of theory, theory, as well as the ability to model human emotions and the perceptual skills to detect emotions.) Also, for good interaction, an intelligent machine also needs to display emotions. At the very least it must appear polite and sensitive to the humans it interacts with. At best, it should have normal emotions itself.CreativityA sub-field of AI addresses creativity both theoretically (from a philosophical and psychological perspective) and practically (via specific implementations of systems that generate outputs that can be considered creative, or systems that identify and assess creativity). A related area of computational research is Intuition and Imagination.General intelligenceMost researchers hope that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with general intelligence (known as AI), combining all the skills above and exceeding human abilities at most or all of them.( A few believe that anthropomorphic features like consciousness or an brain may be required for such a project.((Many of the problems above are considered AI-complete: to solve one problem, you must solve them all. For example, even a straightforward, specific task like translation requires that the machine follow the authors argument (reason), know what is being talked about (knowledge), and faithfully reproduce the authors intention (social intelligence). translation, therefore, is believed to be AI-complete: it may require AI to be done as well as humans can do it.( Approaches There is no established unifying theory or paradigm that guides AI research. Researchers disagree about many issues.(Nils Nilsson writes: Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about .) A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying psychology or neurology? Or is human biology as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to engineering?(Can intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic or optimization)? Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?(Can intelligence be reproduced using high-level symbols, similar to words and ideas? Or does it require sub-symbolic processing?(John Haugeland, who coined the term GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence), also proposed that AI should more properly be referred to as intelligence, a term which has since been adopted by some non-GOFAI researchers.http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi10.1.1.38.8384&reprep1&typepdfhttp://books.google.com/books?hlen&lr&ida ZR81Z25z0C&oifnd&pgPA63&dqrelated:iCpuTpmGk6gJ:scholar.google.com/&otsn1-TsvqXGJ&sig1xthOJ2WQmKtdSt7ISFH2yu2l3Q#vonepage&q&ffalsehttp://www.imagination-engines.com/ Cybernetics and brain simulation is currently no consensus on how closely the brain should be simulated.In the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between neurology, theory, and cybernetics. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as Grey Walters turtles and the Hopkins Beast. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at University and the Club in England.( By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s. Symbolic When access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions: CMU, Stanford and MIT, and each one developed its own style of research. Haugeland named these approaches to AI good old fashioned AI or GOFAI.(; Cognitive simulation: Economist Simon and Newell studied human problem solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as science, research and science. Their research team used the results of  psychological experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems. This tradition, centered at Mellon University would eventually culminate in the development of the Soar architecture in the middle 80s.((; Logic-based: Unlike Newell and Simon, John McCarthy felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving, regardless of whether people used the same algorithms.( His laboratory at Stanford (SAIL) focused on using formal logic to solve a wide variety of problems, including representation, planning and learning.( Logic was also focus of the work at the of Edinburgh and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language Prolog and the science of programming.(; Anti-logic or scruffy: Researchers at MIT (such as Minsky and Papert)( found that solving difficult problems in vision and language processing required ad-hoc solutions  they argued that there was no simple and general principle (like logic) that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior. Schank described their anti-logic approaches as scruffy (as opposed to the neat paradigms at CMU and Stanford).( knowledge bases (such as Lenats Cyc) are an example of scruffy AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.(; Knowledge-based: When computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build knowledge into AI applications.( This knowledge revolution led to the development and deployment of systems (introduced by Feigenbaum), the first truly successful form of AI software.( The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications. Sub-symbolic During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level thinking in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on cybernetics or networks were abandoned or pushed into the background.(The most dramatic case of sub-symbolic AI being pushed into the background was the devastating critique of perceptrons by Minsky and Papert in 1969. See of AI, winter, or Rosenblatt.) By the 1980s, however, progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and recognition. A number of researchers began to look into sub-symbolic approaches to specific AI problems.(; Bottom-up, embodied, situated, behavior-based or AI: Researchers from the related field of robotics, such as Brooks, rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive.( Their work revived the non-symbolic viewpoint of the early cybernetics researchers of the 50s and reintroduced the use of theory in AI. This coincided with the development of the mind thesis in the related field of science: the idea that aspects of the body (such as  movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.; Computational Intelligence: Interest in networks and connectionism was revived by Rumelhart and others in the middle 1980s.( These and other sub-symbolic approaches, such as systems and computation, are now studied collectively by the emerging discipline of intelligence.(StatisticalIn the 1990s, AI researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems. These tools are truly scientific, in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable, and they have been responsible for many of AIs recent successes. The shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like mathematics, economics or research). Stuart Russell and Norvig describe this movement as nothing less than a revolution and the victory of the neats.( Critiques argue that these techniques are too focussed on particular problems and have failed to address the long term goal of general intelligence. Integrating the approaches ;Intelligent agent paradigm: An agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as firms). The paradigm gives researchers license to study isolated problems and find solutions that are both verifiable and useful, without agreeing on one single approach. An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works  some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic networks and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fieldssuch as theory and economicsthat also use concepts of abstract agents. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.(;architectures and architectures: Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting agents in a system.( A system with both symbolic and sub-symbolic components is a intelligent system, and the study of such systems is intelligence systems integration. A control system provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling.( Brooks architecture was an early proposal for such a hierarchical system.( Tools In the course of 50 years of research, AI has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in science. A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below. Search and optimization Many problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:( Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an rule.( Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called analysis.( Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in space.( Many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimization.Simple exhaustive searches( are rarely sufficient for most real world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use heuristics or rules of thumb that eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to the goal (called pruning the tree). Heuristics supply the program with a best guess for the path on which the solution lies.(A very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are annealing, search and optimization.(computation uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Forms of computation include intelligence algorithms (such as ant colony or swarm optimization)( and algorithms (such as algorithms and programming).( Logic Logic( is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning( and logic programming is a method for learning.(Several different forms of logic are used in AI research. Propositional or logic( is the logic of statements which can be true or false. logic( also allows the use of quantifiers and predicates, and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. logic,( is a version of first-order logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1, rather than simply True (1) or False (0). systems can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems. logic( models uncertainty in a different and more explicit manner than fuzzy-logic: a given binomial opinion satisfies belief + disbelief + uncertainty  1 within a distribution. By this method, ignorance can be distinguished from probabilistic statements that an agent makes with high confidence.logics, logics and circumscription( are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the problem. Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge, such as: logics;( calculus, calculus and calculus (for representing events and time);( causal calculus;( belief calculus; and logics.(Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoningMany problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.(networks( are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems: reasoning (using the inference algorithm),( learning (using the algorithm),( planning (using networks)( and perception (using Bayesian networks).( Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., Markov models or filters).(A key concept from the science of economics is utility: a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using theory, analysis,( information value theory.( These tools include models such as decision processes,( dynamic networks,( theory and design.( Classifiers and statistical learning methods The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (if shiny then diamond) and controllers (if shiny then pick up). Controllers do however also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. Classifiers are functions that use matching to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.(A classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and learning approaches. The most widely used classifiers are the neural network,(methods such as the vector machine,(neighbor algorithm,(mixture model,(Bayes classifier,(and decision tree.(The performance of these classifiers have been compared over a wide range of tasks. Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified. There is no single classifier that works best on all given problems; this is also referred to as the no free lunch theorem. Determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is still more an art than science.( Neural networks File:Artificial neural network.svg|thumb|A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the brain.The study of neural networks( began in the decade before the field AI research was founded, in the work of Pitts and McCullough. Other important early researchers were Rosenblatt, who invented the perceptron and Werbos who developed the backpropagation algorithm.(The main categories of networks are acyclic or neural networks (where the signal passes in only one direction) and neural networks (which allow feedback). Among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons, perceptrons and basis networks.( Among recurrent networks, the most famous is the net, a form of attractor network, which was first described by Hopfield in 1982.( Neural networks can be applied to the problem of control (for robotics) or learning, using such techniques as learning and learning.(temporal memory is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex.( Control theory theory, the grandchild of cybernetics, has many important applications, especially in robotics.( Languages AI researchers have developed several specialized languages for AI research, including Lisp( and Prolog.(Evaluating progress In 1950, Alan Turing proposed a general procedure to test the intelligence of an agent now known as the test. This procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested. However, it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail.(Artificial intelligence can also be evaluated on specific problems such as small problems in chemistry, hand-writing recognition and game-playing. Such tests have been termed matter expert Turing tests. Smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever-increasing number of positive results.(The broad classes of outcome for an AI test are: (1) Optimal: it is not possible to perform better. (2) Strong super-human: performs better than all humans. (3) Super-human: performs better than most humans. (4) Sub-human: performs worse than most humans. For example, performance at draughts is optimal,( performance at chess is super-human and nearing strong super-human (see chess#Computers versus humans) and performance at many everyday tasks (such as recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into something) is sub-human.A quite different approach measures machine intelligence through tests which are developed from mathematical definitions of intelligence. Examples of these kinds of tests start in the late nineties devising intelligence tests using notions from complexity and compression.( Two major advantages of mathematical definitions are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers. Applications File:Automated online assistant.png|thumb|An online assistant providing customer service on a web page - one of many applications of artificial intelligence.Artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list.  Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the effect.() Competitions and prizes There are a number of competitions and prizes to promote research in artificial intelligence. The main areas promoted are: general machine intelligence, conversational behavior, data-mining, driverless cars, robot soccer and games. Platforms A platform (or platform) is defined as some sort of hardware architecture or software framework (including application frameworks), that allows software to run. As Rodney Brooks(Brooks, R.A., How to build complete creatures rather than isolated cognitive simulators, in K. VanLehn (ed.), Architectures for Intelligence, pp. 225239, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Hillsdale, NJ, 1991.) pointed out many years ago, it is not just the artificial intelligence software that defines the AI features of the platform, but rather the actual platform itself that affects the AI that results, i.e., we need to be working out AI problems on real-world platforms rather than in isolation.A wide variety of platforms has allowed different aspects of AI to develop, ranging from systems, albeit PC-based but still an entire real-world system, to various robot platforms such as the widely available Roomba with open interface.(Hacking Roomba  Search Results  atmel) Philosophy Artificial intelligence, by claiming to be able to recreate the capabilities of the human mind, is both a challenge and an inspiration for philosophy. Are there limits to how intelligent machines can be? Is there an essential difference between human intelligence and artificial intelligence? Can a machine have a mind and consciousness? A few of the most influential answers to these questions are given below.(;Turings polite convention: If a machine acts as intelligently as a human being, then it is as intelligent as a human being. Turing theorized that, ultimately, we can only judge the intelligence of a machine based on its behavior. This theory forms the basis of the test.(;The Dartmouth proposal: Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. This conjecture was printed in the proposal for the Dartmouth Conference of 1956, and represents the position of most working AI researchers.(; Newell and Simons physical symbol system hypothesis: A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action. Newell and Simon argue that intelligences consists of formal operations on symbols.( Dreyfus argued that, on the contrary, human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. (See critique of AI.)(Dreyfus criticized the necessary condition of the symbol system hypothesis, which he called the psychological assumption: The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules. )(; incompleteness theorem: A system (such as a computer program) can not prove all true statements.(This is a paraphrase of the relevant implication of Gdels theorems.) Penrose is among those who claim that Gdels theorem limits what machines can do. (See Emperors New Mind.)(; Searles strong AI hypothesis: The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.( John Searle counters this assertion with his room argument, which asks us to look inside the computer and try to find where the mind might be.(; The brain argument: The brain can be simulated. Moravec, Kurzweil and others have argued that it is technologically feasible to copy the brain directly into hardware and software, and that such a simulation will be essentially identical to the original.( Predictions Artificial Intelligence is a common topic in both fiction and projections about the future of technology and society. The existence of an artificial intelligence that rivals human intelligence raises difficult ethical issues, and the potential power of the technology inspires both hopes and fears.In fiction, Artificial Intelligence has appeared fulfilling many roles, includinga servant (R2D2 in Wars),a law enforcer (K.I.T.T. Knight Rider),a comrade (Lt. Commander Data in Trek: The Next Generation),a conqueror/overlord (Matrix),a dictator (Folded Hands),a benevolent provider/de facto ruler (Culture),an assassin (Terminator),a sentient race (Battlestar Galactica/Transformers),an extension to human abilities (in the Shell)and the savior of the human race (Daneel Olivaw in the Robot Series).Shelleys Frankenstein considers a key issue in the of artificial intelligence: if a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also feel? If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human? The idea also appears in modern fiction, including the films I Robot, Runner and Artificial Intelligence, in which humanoid machines have the ability to feel human emotions. This issue, now known as rights, is currently being considered by, for example, Californias for the Future, although many critics believe that the discussion is premature.( The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film & Pray.(http://www.plugandpray-film.de/en/content.html Independent documentary Plug & Pray, featuring Joseph Weizenbaum and Raymond Kurzweil)Martin Ford, author of The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future,() and others argue that specialized artificial intelligence applications, robotics and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant unemployment as machines begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine and repetitive jobs. Ford predicts that many knowledge-based occupationsand in particular entry level jobswill be increasingly susceptible to automation via expert systems, machine learning(Machine Learning: A Job Killer?) and other AI-enhanced applications. AI-based applications may also be used to amplify the capabilities of low-wage offshore workers, making it more feasible to outsource knowledge work.(Weizenbaum wrote that AI applications can not, by definition, successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of AI technology in fields such as service or psychotherapy(In the early 70s, Colby presented a version of Weizenbaums ELIZA known as DOCTOR which he promoted as a serious therapeutic tool. ) was deeply misguided. Weizenbaum was also bothered that AI researchers (and some philosophers) were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program (a position now known as computationalism). To Weizenbaum these points suggest that AI research devalues human life.(Many futurists believe that artificial intelligence will ultimately transcend the limits of progress. Kurzweil has used law (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029. He also predicts that by 2045 artificial intelligence will reach a point where it is able to improve itself at a rate that far exceeds anything conceivable in the past, a scenario that fiction writer Vinge named the singularity.(Robot designer Moravec, cyberneticist Warwick and inventor Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either.( This idea, called transhumanism, which has roots in Huxley and Ettinger, has been illustrated in fiction as well, for example in the manga in the Shell and the science-fiction series Dune.Fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution, an idea first proposed by Samuel Butlers among the Machines (1863), and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the same name in 1998.(McCorduck writes that all these scenarios are expressions of the ancient human desire to, as she calls it, forge the gods.(See also* intelligence in fiction* Intelligence (journal)* intelligence (video games)* intelligence* sciences* artificial intelligence* of basic artificial intelligence topics* Artificial intelligence researchers* List of important AI publications* List of AI projects* of emerging technologies* of scientific journals* of mind* singularity* Language Learning* Description of Machine Learning field References  Notes ((TOPIO:* * ))(Definition of AI as the study of agents:* , which provides the version that is used in this article.
